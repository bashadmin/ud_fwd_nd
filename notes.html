        markup consists of tags and <em>elements</em></em>
    </h2>
<p>
    New paragraphs can be made using p tags!
</p>
<p>
    This is important when you start using css.

<sup>Here is some text, now testing the sup tag!</sup>

<p>
    Sometimes when doing math you need to use a superscript.<br>
    They look kinda like this 2<sup>2</sup></sup>
</p>
<p>
    There are other times when you need to use a subscript.<br><br>
    Like in chemistry when talking about H<sub>2</sub>O.</sup>
</p>
<p>
    You can't put paragraph tags in paragraphs, and little elements can't overlap but can be used togeter.<br>

    <strong>Molecule name:</strong> <em>Sulfur hexafluoride</em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Molecular formula:</strong> SF<sub>6</sub>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> This gas has a much higher density than air. Basically the opposite of helium. <mark>Crazy!</mark>

  Just don't call me <strong>late.</strong>

      Call me Ishmael.

<p>
      Just don't call me late for dinner.

<ol>
    <li>ol vs ul</li>
    <ul>
        <li>You can nest ul in ol.</li>
        <li>More information can be here.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>When you leave off closing tags, your browser knows.</li>
    <ul>
        <li>This works for &ltp&gt.</li>
        <li>This works for &ltli&gt, when nested in ol or ul of course.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
<p>
    p and li are the two elements you've seen with optional closing tags.
     And the browser knows there has to be a closing tag when it gets to
      the start tag of a new element that can't be inside of the last one.
       For example, when it gets to the start of a new p element, it knows
        the previous p element must be closed.
