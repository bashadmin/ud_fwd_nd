        markup consists of tags and <em>elements</em>
    </h2>
<p>
    New paragraphs can be made using p tags!
</p>
<p>
    This is important when you start using css.
</p>
<p>
<sub>Here is some text, testing the sub tag.</sub>
<sup>Here is some text, now testing the sup tag!</sup>
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes when doing math you need to use a superscript.<br>
    They look kinda like this 2<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<p>
    There are other times when you need to use a subscript.<br><br>
    Like in chemistry when talking about H<sub>2</sub>O.
</p>
<p>
    You can't put paragraph tags in paragraphs, and little elements can't overlap but can be used togeter.<br>
    <mark><em>Like this!</em></mark>, you got it?

<h1>My Chemistry Notes</h1>

    <strong>Molecule name:</strong> <em>Sulfur hexafluoride</em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Molecular formula:</strong> SF<sub>6</sub>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> This gas has a much higher density than air. Basically the opposite of helium. <mark>Crazy!</mark>

  Call me <em>maybe?</em>
  <br><br>
  Just don't call me <strong>late.</strong>
</p>  
<p>
      Call me Ishmael.

<p>
      Just don't call me late for dinner.

<ol>
    <li>ol vs ul
    <ul>
        <li>You can nest ul in ol.
        <li>More information can be here.
    </ul>
    <li>When you leave off closing tags, your browser knows.
    <ul>
        <li>This works for &lt;p&gt;.
        <li>This works for &lt;li&gt;, when nested in ol or ul of course.
    </ul>
</ol>
<p>
    p and li are the two elements you've seen with optional closing tags.
     And the browser knows there has to be a closing tag when it gets to
      the start tag of a new element that can't be inside of the last one.
       For example, when it gets to the start of a new p element, it knows
        the previous p element must be closed.
